# Expressiveness analysis
A spreadsheet program (`Transparenzinformationen.xlsx` and `header.py`) was used to examine the individual privacy policies. Each decision was also documented by means of text extracts. In addition, a Python script has been developed which could be used to carry out more detailed analyses, e.g. on the frequency of occurrences of non-compliance. The software also automatically downloads the full text of the current privacy policy (`crawler.py`). Thus, the study could also be repeated at a comparative point in time. The study was conducted mainly in German language, the summary is translated into English.
